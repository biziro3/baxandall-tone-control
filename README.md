# Baxandall Tone-Control

A Baxandall tone controller is an audio tone control circuit that allows smooth and symmetrical adjustment of bass and treble frequencies. It typically uses an operational amplifier along with a network of resistors and capacitors to shape the frequency response. Known for its simplicity and low distortion, the Baxandall circuit is widely used in audio equipment such as amplifiers and mixers to improve sound quality.

# Brief info 
The schematic was takeb from the internet , and i've tried to understad what is doing the schematic with the help from the videos/document from Links. The main purpose of this project was to make the layout of this board and learn how to use Altium Designer
