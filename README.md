# baxandall-tone-control

A Baxandall tone controller is an audio tone control circuit that allows smooth and symmetrical adjustment of bass and treble frequencies. It typically uses an operational amplifier along with a network of resistors and capacitors to shape the frequency response. Known for its simplicity and low distortion, the Baxandall circuit is widely used in audio equipment such as amplifiers and mixers to improve sound quality.
